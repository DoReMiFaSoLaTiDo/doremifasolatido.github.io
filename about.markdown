I have been variously described as innovative, funny and kind. Indeed, I 'm all that and more. 

I 'm an engaging personality with a pretty hands-on approach to tasks -- taking personal interests in assignments and delegating where necessary. I love working on projects that are public-facing, do the most good, and contribute to human development.
